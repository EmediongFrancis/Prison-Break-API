However, Lincoln tells a guard that Sucre has a cellphone in his possession. When Sucre is asked about the phone from a guard, he denies it, even to the point of losing his conjugal. This proves to Michael that his cellmate can hold a secret.\n\nHowever, Sucre bargains with Michael for use of the phone, until Michael reveals that it is just a replica carved out of soap.

When Haywire\'s doctor came to visit him, he is forced to take his pills for his \"schizoaffective disorder with bipolar tendencies\".

After explaining this to Sucre, Sucre admits that \"there are only three certain things in life. Death, taxes and count.\" The only time count doesn\'t take place is during a lockdown. Michael uses his access to the inside of the walls to turn off the air conditioning. The prisoners suffer in the heat, leading T-Bag to start a fight with a guard who initiates a lock-down while some of the prisoners are out of their cells. The prisoners riot and break into the prison cell control room, in which T-Bag opens all the cells and then finds a set of keys, giving him and the rioters access to the entire prison.'),(7,'Riots, Drills and the Devil 2','S01E07','C-Note, T-Bag, Kellerman, Fernando Sucre, Mike, Lincoln, Bellick, Abruzzi, Warden Pope, Sara Tancredi','\"Riots, Drills and the Devil, Part 2\" is the seventh episode of the first season of Prison Break and the seventh episode overall.

However Lincoln manages to kill him before he can do any real damage.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Michael\'s and Sucre\'s cell, T-Bag is keeping an eye on the guard who knows of their escape plan, while making crude remarks about his daughter. John Abruzzi enters the hole and helps Sucre with breaking down the wall, their respective strict religious beliefs adding a second dimension to the plot as they are drilling through the devil. While they are in the pipes, Sara asks how Michael knows about the pipes and he replies by saying he\'s had PI duties removing chemical waste.\n\nAbruzzi and Sucre manage to break down the wall and laugh in excitement. Michael and Sara manage to get to an exit of the prison but a sniper brings his sights onto Michael, though he is unable to shoot until Sara is free.

When Seth asks him for help the second time, Michael turns his back on him.\n\nThe team continues to work on pounding the concrete floor in the storage room during PI. Sucre worries over how they are going to dispose of the concrete fragments. Michael tells them to hide the fragments one piece at a time. They take the pieces out, littering and hiding them all over the yard. After Michael walks off, C-Note picks up one of the concrete fragments half hidden in the yard. As Michael and Sucre walk back to their cells, Seth jumps off from the second tier and hangs himself. Michael looks horrified.\n\nMichael tells Lincoln of Seth\'s suicide and how he felt responsible for his death.
